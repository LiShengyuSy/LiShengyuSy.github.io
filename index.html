  <h2>About&nbsp;Me</h2>

  <p>
    I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST),
    working with <a href="https://cse.hkust.edu.hk/admin/people/faculty/profile/lim" target="_blank">Prof. Mo Li</a>. I received my Ph.D. in 2025 from 
    the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of 
    <a href="https://www.scse.uestc.edu.cn/info/1081/12001.htm" target="_blank">Prof. Li Lu</a>. Earlier, I obtained my B.E. degree in 2019 from 
    the Xi’an University of Posts and Telecommunications (XUPT).
  </p>

  <p>
    My research interests lie in <strong>system security</strong>, <strong>wireless and physical‑layer security</strong>, and <strong>acoustic security</strong>.  
    I have actively participated in several key and general projects funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC), 
    achieving notable outcomes in domains such as <em>physical‑layer threat detection</em>, 
    <em>wireless bus architectures</em>, and <em>IoT security</em>.  
    As the first or primary author, I have published seven papers at leading venues including 
    <strong>ACM MobiCom</strong> and <strong>IEEE TDSC</strong>, and am currently applying for three national invention patents.
    Through extensive research experience in system design and security, I emphasize a balance between theory and practice, 
    aspiring to address real‑world system security challenges with innovative solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    My ongoing research focuses on <strong>intelligent localization and sensing using wireless signals</strong>.  
    By leveraging ambient signals—including various radio frequencies (e.g., Wi‑Fi, millimeter wave) and acoustic waves—I develop methods to perceive and interpret environmental dynamics.  
    I explore the evolution of IoT technologies, particularly Wi‑Fi, Bluetooth, and LoRaWAN, 
    to meet practical industrial needs, emphasizing robust network reliability and optimized Quality of Service (QoS).
